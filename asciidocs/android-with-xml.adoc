== Kotlin Basics

Kotlin does not allow implicit type conversions.
So you can't assign a short value directly to a long variable, or an Int to a Long.
This is because implicit number conversion is a common source of errors in programs.
You can always assign values of different types by casting.


== Use RecyclerView to display a scrollable list

image:recyclerview-overview.png[]


* *item* - One data item of the list to display. Represents one Affirmation object in your app.
* *Adapter* - Takes data and prepares it for RecyclerView to display.
* *ViewHolders* - A pool of views for RecyclerView to use and reuse to display affirmations.
* *RecyclerView* - Views on screen


=== Packages

https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-recyclerview-scrollable-list?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcourses%2Fpathways%2Fandroid-development-with-kotlin-5%23codelab-https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcodelabs%2Fbasic-android-kotlin-training-recyclerview-scrollable-list#2[Setting up the list of data]

* There are two ways in which you can make use of packages.

** Create different packages for different parts of your code.
For example, developers will often separate the classes that work with data and the classes that build the UI into different packages.
** Use code from other packages in your code.
In order to use the classes from other packages, you need to define them in your build system's dependencies.
+
It's also a standard practice to import them in your code so you can use their shortened names (eg, TextView) instead of their fully-qualified names (eg, android.widget.TextView). For example, you have already used import statements for classes such as sqrt (import kotlin.math.sqrt) and View (import android.view.View).

=== Datasource

* Create a class to be a data source

** Data displayed in your app may come from different sources (e.g. within your app project or from an external source that requires connecting to the internet to download data).
+
As a result, data may not be in the exact format that you need.
The rest of the app should not concern itself with where the data originates from or in what format it is originally.
You can and should hide away this data preparation in a separate Datasource class that prepares the data for the app.

=== RecyclerView

https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-recyclerview-scrollable-list?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcourses%2Fpathways%2Fandroid-development-with-kotlin-5%23codelab-https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcodelabs%2Fbasic-android-kotlin-training-recyclerview-scrollable-list#3[Adding a RecyclerView too your app]

RecyclerView supports displaying items in different ways, such as a linear list or a grid.
Arranging the items is handled by a LayoutManager.
The Android framework provides layout managers for basic item layouts.
The Affirmations app displays items as a vertical list, so you can use the LinearLayoutManager.

=== Adapter

* Adapter is a design pattern that adapts the data into something that can be used by RecyclerView.
+
In this case, you need an adapter that takes an Affirmation instance from the list returned by loadAffirmations(), and turns it into a list item view, so that it can be displayed in the RecyclerView.
+
When you run the app, RecyclerView uses the adapter to figure out how to display your data on screen.
+
RecyclerView asks the adapter to create a new list item view for the first data item in your list.
+
Once it has the view, it asks the adapter to provide the data to draw the item.
This process repeats until the RecyclerView doesn't need any more views to fill the screen.
If only 3 list item views fit on the screen at once, the RecyclerView only asks the adapter to prepare those 3 list item views (instead of all 10 list item views).

=== ViewHolder



* RecyclerView doesn't interact directly with item views, but deals with ViewHolders instead.

* A ViewHolder represents a single list item view in RecyclerView, and can be reused when possible.

* A ViewHolder instance holds references to the individual views within a list item layout (hence the name "view holder"). This makes it easier to update the list item view with new data.
View holders also add information that RecyclerView uses to efficiently move views around the screen.

[source,kotlin]
----
class ItemAdapter(private val context: Context, private val dataset: List<Affirmation>) {

    class ItemViewHolder()
}
----

* Defining a class inside another class is called creating a nested class.
* Since ItemViewHolder is only used by ItemAdapter, creating it inside ItemAdapter shows this relationship. This is not mandatory, but it helps other developers understand the structure of your program.

[TIP]
====
* when "unresolved reference" zB bei RecyclerView oder Context -> kbd:[Invalidate Caches/Restart]
* search for a library w/ the IDE

=== Lernzielkontolle

* Klasse Datasource und eine Entity Klasse

* Erstellen sie eine Kotlin Liste mit folgenden Einträgen
** ...

* Stellen sie die Anzahl der Einträge in der vorhandenen TextView dar.

== Fragments

A Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface (UI) in an Activity. You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI, and you can reuse a Fragment in multiple activities.

* Think of a Fragment as a modular section of an activity, something like a "sub-activity" that you can also use in other activities:

** Fragment has its own lifecycle and receives its own input events.
** You can add or remove a Fragment while the activity is running.
** Fragment is defined in a Kotlin class.
** Fragment's UI is defined in an XML layout file.

* DataBindingUtil: Utility class to create ViewDataBinding from layouts.

* Summary

** A Fragment is a modular section of an activity.
** A Fragment has its own lifecycle and receives its own input events.
** Use the <fragment> tag to define the layout for the Fragment in the XML layout file.
** Inflate the layout for a Fragment in onCreateView().
** You can add or remove a Fragment while the activity is running.
